# Debian-DietPi-Install-Script
<!-- markdownlint-configure-file { "MD004": { "style": "consistent" } } -->
<!-- markdownlint-disable MD033 -->

## WARNING: 
This script is based on DIETPI v7.5. DietPi master is currently on v8.12. After DIETPI v8.4 the PREP_SYSTEM_FOR_DIETPI.sh script was repalced with a new installer script. I have just updated the github URL to the latest image, use at your own risk.

## Install Dietpi for [Ionos](https://ionos.com)/VM
 
Those who want to get started quickly and conveniently may install DietPi for ionos/vm using the following commands:

`wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Pieloaf/Debian-DietPi-Install-Script/main/debian-dietpi-install.sh`

`chmod +x debian-dietpi-install.sh`

`./debian-dietpi-install.sh`

### Optimise current Debian install and prepare DietPi installation for Ionos/VM servers

Script is made to work for Debian installs on Ionos/VM cloud servers but relies heavily on the premade installer from DietPi itself:
https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/blob/master/.build/images/dietpi-installer and is based off [Github Issue #2995](https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/2995)
